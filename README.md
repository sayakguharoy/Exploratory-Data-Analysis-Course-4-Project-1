### Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Course-4-Project-1
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

### The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

 * Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
 * Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
 * Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
 * Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
 * Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
 * Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
 * Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
  * Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
    * Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
    
 ### For each plot you should

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
* Name each of the plot files as plot1.png\color{red}{\verb|plot1.png|}plot1.png, plot2.png\color{red}{\verb|plot2.png|}plot2.png, etc.
* Create a separate R code file (plot1.R\color{red}{\verb|plot1.R|}plot1.R, plot2.R\color{red}{\verb|plot2.R|}plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R\color{red}{\verb|plot1.R|}plot1.R constructs the plot1.png\color{red}{\verb|plot1.png|}plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced.
* You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
* Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
